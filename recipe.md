Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and prep a 8x8-inch baking pan with parchment paper.
In a large bowl, combine melted butter, eggs, vanilla extract, and coffee then mix together well.
Add the white and brown sugars to the mixture and whisk together well.
Sift cocoa powder, flour, and salt into the bowl and mix until just combined
Toss in chocolate chips (or chunks) and fold into the batter.
Add batter to pan and smooth to the edges. You can add more chocolate chips to the top before baking if desired.
Bake for about 30 minutes or until the center is just set. You'll notice the center does not wiggle when the pan is moved.
